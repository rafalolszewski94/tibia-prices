# Privacy Policy – Tibia Prices

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Overview

Tibia Prices ("the extension") is a browser extension that displays Tibia Coins (TC) amounts in Polish złoty (PLN) on the official Tibia character trade website. This policy describes how the extension handles information.

## Data collection

The extension **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or usage data** on external servers. No analytics, tracking, or third-party services are used.

## Local data

The only data the extension uses is stored **locally in your browser**:

- **Conversion rate:** If you set a "price per 250 TC" (e.g. 40 PLN) in the extension popup, that single number is saved in your browser's local storage so the extension can show PLN values on Tibia character trade pages. This value never leaves your device and is not sent to us or anyone else.

You can clear this data at any time by removing the extension or clearing the extension's storage in your browser.

## Permissions

- **Storage:** Used only to save and read your chosen conversion rate locally.
- **Access to www.tibia.com/charactertrade:** Used only to display PLN amounts next to TC values on Tibia's character trade pages. Page content is not collected or sent elsewhere.

## Changes to this policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the change will be reflected in the extension's store listing and, if needed, in the extension itself.
